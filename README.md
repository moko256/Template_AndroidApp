# About

Empty application template for Android project for me.

# Usage

```sh
# This is all the thing I want to do.
read n&&git clone https://github.com/moko256/Template_AndroidApp.git $n&&cd $n;echo $n|sh initialize.sh
```

1. Checkout this project (Note: If you only want to use it, you don't have to fork it.)
2. Execute ```initialize.sh```

## initialize.sh's doing:

1. Replace placeholder name "emptyApp" in this project
2. Create folder for java files.
3. Remove .git, README.md and initialize.sh
